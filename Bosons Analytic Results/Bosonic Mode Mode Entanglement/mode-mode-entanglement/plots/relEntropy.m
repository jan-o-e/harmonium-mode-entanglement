%
% relEntropy 
%--------------------
% Approximates the relative entropy of entanglement (REE) of a density 
% matrix of an mxn bipartite system (relative to PPT states). 
%  -Uses CVX solver for semidefinite programming (http://cvxr.com/cvx/). 
%  -Uses PartialTranspose from QETLAB (http://www.qetlab.com) to compute 
%    partial transposes of matrices. 
%    (https://github.com/nathanieljohnston/QETLAB/blob/master/PartialTranspose.m)
%
% Standard usage:  [Xopt,relEntr]=relEntropy(m,n,A)
% Variables:
%    m,n       - dimensions of the subsystems
%    A         - density matrix whose REE we are trying to compute
%    Xopt      - optimal PPT matrix that minimizes the relative entropy
%    relEnt    - output upper bound of relative entropy of entanglement
%
% Optional inputs with defaults:
% relEntropy(m,n,A,eps,maxIter,lineSearchEps)
%    eps           - precision such that |uBound-lBound|<eps (default: eps = 1e-5)
%    maxIter       - max number of iterations (default: maxIter = 200)
%    lineSearchEps - precision of intermediate line search (default: lineSearchEps = 1e-10;)
%
% We define a function traceAlogmA to compute trace(A*logm(A))to accept
% rank-defficnent matrices.
